<b>Merge Sort</b>

This code demonstrates the Merge Sort algorithm. The Merge Sort algorithm takes a list of values, divides it into two or more sublists, sorts the sublists, and then merges them together. This is a type of "divide and conquer" methodology. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n).
