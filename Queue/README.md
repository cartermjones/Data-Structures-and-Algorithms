<b>Queue</b>

This code demonstrates the queue data structure. 

A queue adds items (enqueues them) to the back of the queue, and removes (dequeues) them from the front,
thus following a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering. 

This code contains methods to create queues, check if the queue is empty or full, enqueue or dequeue items, 
and so forth.
