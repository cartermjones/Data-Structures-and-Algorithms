<b>Stack</b>

This code demonstrates the Stack data structure.

A stack functions by pushing objects to the top of the stack in order to add to the stack,
and popping objects off of the stack to remove them - thus following a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
ordering.

This code contains methods to create a stack, check if it's full or empty, as well as push items to
or pop them off of the stack.
